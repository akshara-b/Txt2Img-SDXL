# Text-to-Image with SDXL
A simple project using Stable Diffusion XL to generate images from text prompts. Built in Google Colab with Python.

## How It Works
- Takes a text prompt (e.g., "A cyberpunk city at dusk").
- Uses SDXL to create a 1024x1024 image.
- Saves the output as a PNG.

## Files
- `Text2Image.ipynb`: Colab notebook with the full code.
- `output1.png`: Sample image generated.
- `output2.png`: Sample image generated.

## Try It
Open the notebook in Colab and run it with a T4 GPU!
